# L-layer Cat Analyser

## Problem: Differentiate between a cat and a non-cat image using a neural network with 4 layers.

Given a train and a test dataset labeled with cat and non-cat images, we must train an algorithm to tell if the input image is a cat (1) or not a cat (0).

The algorithm is implemented using Logistic Regression, with the Cost Function as a measure of how well our learning algorithm is doing.

Similar to what we did on the Simple Cat Analyser case, we use an L-layer neural network to improve our results, obtaining **80%** of accuracy on the test set, 
opposed to 70% obtained using only one layer!
